## Analysis & Recommendations
After analyzing the months of June and December we found out that the data analyzed is very similar between them both. The climate does not change the activities of the area; the only important variable is the lowest temperature of December of 56.

My recommendations are the following:

- Collect the data of the last 5 year minimum of the area where the store is located to analyze the variables of the weather and have a plan ready for the next year.

- Research and collect data of the stores around in the area to analyze them and find out which ones have been successful and which ones have not and the reason for this.

- In the last few years the climate has been drastically changing world wide, because of this it is important to do an in-depth research to collect the data necessary in order to analyze how much it has changed in the past 5 years and create a plan based on this.
